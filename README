# ng-npn-data-quality

Next Generation NPN Data Quality Tool
Interpolates model wind profiles to a regular grid,
to be compared with wind profiles from the NPN radars.
Model data originates from NOMADS. NAM 3-km model 
data is the most reliable model for Alaska. HRRR data is 
the backup model source, and is retrieved from Google Cloud to enable
backfills.

## Installation

Required python packages are provided in the requirements.txt file.
This python2 environment can be recreated by running a single command, 
as demonstrated below. The most important python package, py-ncepbufr, 
is provided as a compiled RPM in the rpm folder.

```bash
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Cronjobs must be added to the users crontab to download new model data.
A template is provided in the cronjobs folder. HRRR CONUS is downloaded every
hour, HRRR AK every 3 hours, and NAM 3-km every 6 hours (UTC).

## Usage

The server can be run from the command line by invoking the following command.
```bash
python compare_npn_to_model.py
```
If you are simply running the server and viewing the data from the same machine (default),
SERVER_IP_ADDRESS in config.json can remain as "localhost". If you are serving on the ROC
LAN SERVER_IP_ADDRESS must be to the internal LAN IP ADDRESS of your machine, which will follow
the pattern of "10.20.58.*".
